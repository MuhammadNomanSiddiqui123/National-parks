              <h5 class="card-title">Chelonia mydas</h5>
              <p class="card-text">The green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas), also known as the green turtle, black (sea)
                turtle or Pacific green turtle, is a species of large sea turtle of the family Cheloniidae. It is the
                only species in the genus Chelonia. Its range extends throughout tropical and subtropical seas around
                the world, with two distinct populations in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, but it is also found in the
                Indian Ocean. The common name refers to the usually green fat found beneath its carapace, due to
                its diet strictly being seagrass, not to the color of its carapace, which is olive to black.The
                dorsoventrally flattened body of C. mydas is covered by a large, teardrop-shaped carapace; it has a pair
                of large, paddle-like flippers. It is usually lightly colored, although in the eastern Pacific
                populations, parts of the carapace can be almost black. Unlike other members of its family, such as the
                hawksbill sea turtle, C.mydas is mostly herbivorous. The adults usually inhabit shallow lagoons, feeding
                mostly on various species of seagrasses.Like other sea turtles, green sea turtles migrate long distances
                between feeding grounds and hatching beaches. Many islands worldwide are known as Turtle Island due to
                green sea turtles nesting on their beaches. Females crawl out on beaches, dig nests, and lay eggs during
                the night. Later, hatchlings emerge, and scramble into the water. Those that reach maturity may live to
                90 years in the wild. Many turtles die after being caught in fishing nets. In addition, real estate

              <h5 class="card-title">Archelon</h5>
              <p class="card-text">Archelon is an extinct marine turtle from the Late Cretaceous, and is the largest
                turtle ever to have been documented, with the biggest specimen measuring 4.6 m (15 ft) from head to tail
                and 2.2–3.2 t (2.4–3.5 short tons) in body mass. It is known only from the Pierre Shale and has one
                species, A. ischyros. In the past, the genus also contained A. marshii and A. copei, though these have
                been reassigned to Protostega and Kansastega, respectively. The genus was named in 1895 by American
                paleontologist George Reber Wieland based on a skeleton from South Dakota, who placed it into the
                extinct family Protostegidae.In 1900, Wieland described a second species, A. marshii, from remains
                collected in 1898 by American paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh, to whom the species name refers, on
                the basis that the shell underside (plastron) was thicker and the humeri were straighter.[9] However, in
                1909, Wieland reclassified it as Protostega marshii. In 1902, a third, mostly complete specimen was
                collected also along the Cheyenne River.In the same study, Protostega copei from Kansas, which was first
                described by Wieland in 1909 </p>

              <h5 class="card-title">Protostega</h5>
              <p class="card-text">Protostega is an extinct genus of sea turtle that thrived during the Late Cretaceous
                period,
                approximately 70 to 75 million years ago. Known for being one of the largest sea turtles, it could grow
                up
                to 3 meters (10 feet) in length, featuring a streamlined body and flipper-like limbs that made it
                well-suited for life in the ocean. Fossils of Protostega have predominantly been discovered in North
                America, offering crucial insights into the evolution and adaptations of marine reptiles. Its unique
                characteristics, including a large, flattened shell, highlight the diverse adaptations that sea turtles
                have
                undergone throughout their history,Yes, Protostega lived in water and was fully adapted to an aquatic
                lifestyle. Like modern sea turtles, it had flipper-like limbs for swimming and a streamlined body, which
                helped it navigate through the ocean. Fossil evidence indicates that it inhabited marine environments,he
                classification of Protostega was complicated at best. The specimen that Cope discovered in Kansas was
                hard to evaluate with the preservation condition. The fossil shared many characteristics with two other
                recorded genus named Dermochelys and Cheloniidae. Cope wrote about the characteristics that distinctly
                separated this particular species from the two controversial groups.The differences he described were
                that the fossil had a reduced or lacking amount of dermal ossification on the back.

              <h5 class="card-title">Spotted turtle</h5>
              <p class="card-text">The spotted turtle (Clemmys guttata), the only species of the genus Clemmys, is a
                small, semi-aquatic turtle that reaches a carapace length of 8–12 cm (3.1–4.7 in) upon adulthood.
                Their broad, smooth, low dark-colored upper shell, or carapace, ranges in its exact colour from black to
                a bluish black with a number of tiny yellow round spots. The spotting patterning extends from the head,
                to the neck and out onto the limbs. Sexually mature males have a concave plastron and a long, thick
                tail. By contrast, sexually mature females possess a flat plastron and have a tail that is noticeably
                shorter and thinner than that of mature males. Mature males also have a dark iris and face; females
                typically have a yellow or orange iris and a similarly coloured face that is distinctly lighter than the
                males'. Juveniles appear female-like in this regard, and at maturity males begin to develop darker
                features.Spotted turtles are aquatic omnivores that inhabit a variety of semi-aquatic or in other words,
                shallow, fresh-water areas such as flooded forests, marshes, wet meadows, bogs and woodland streams in
                southern Canada (Ontario) and the eastern US: the eastern Great Lakes and east of the Appalachian
                Mountains.Visual differences between male and female turtles develop around the time of sexual maturity.
                The male spotted turtle has a tan chin, brown eyes, and a long, thick tail. The chin of the female is
                yellow; she also has orange eyes and a shorter tail than the male. In addition, the bottom shell of
                males is concave while it is either flat or convex in females.On average, females grow to be slightly
                larger than males.[10] Also, females have more spots than males (on average).
