              <h5 class="card-title">Jersey cow </h5>
              <p class="card-text">The Jersey cow is a small to medium-sized breed known for its exceptional milk
                production and
                high butterfat content, making it a favorite among dairy farmers. Originating from the Channel Islands
                of
                Jersey, these cows are easily recognizable by their light brown or fawn coats, often with darker accents
                around the face and legs. They are renowned for their gentle temperament and adaptability to various
                farming
                systems, which contributes to their popularity in both large and small dairy operations. Jersey cows
                typically reach maturity earlier than many other breeds, and their milk is prized not only for its
                richness
                but also for its flavor. With a long lifespan and good reproductive efficiency, Jerseys are not only
                efficient producers but also resilient animals, making them a valuable asset in the dairy industry.The
                Jersey cow is a highly regarded dairy breed known for its rich milk, which contains one of the highest
                butterfat percentages among all cattle breeds, often exceeding 5%. Originating from the Isle of Jersey
                in
                the English Channel, these cows are typically medium-sized, with a compact build that contributes to
                their
                are known for their adaptability to different farming conditions and climates.As its name implies, the
                Jersey was bred on the British Channel Island of Jersey. It apparently descended from cattle stock
                brought over from the nearby Norman mainland, and was first recorded as a separate breed around 1700.
                There is evidence the breed is related to the African buffalo, possibly the Bos brachyceros.In 1789,
                imports of foreign cattle into Jersey were forbidden by law to maintain the purity of the breed,
                although exports of cattle and semen have been important economic resources for the island. The
                restriction on the import of cattle was initially introduced to prevent a collapse in the export price.
                The United Kingdom levied no import duty on cattle imported from Jersey. Cattle were being shipped from
                France to Jersey and then shipped onward to England to circumvent the tariff on French cattle. The
                increase in the supply of cattle, sometimes of inferior quality, was bringing the price down and
                damaging the reputation of Jersey cattle. The import ban stabilised .</p>

              <h5 class="card-title">Holstein cow </h5>
              <p class="card-text">The Holstein cow is one of the most recognizable and widely recognized dairy breeds,
                known for
                its striking black-and-white coloration. Originating from the Netherlands and northern Germany,
                Holsteins
                have become synonymous with dairy farming due to their high milk production capabilities. They are
                large,
                robust animals, typically weighing between 1,200 and 1,800 pounds, and are well-adapted to various
                climates
                and farming practices. Holsteins are particularly valued for their ability to produce large volumes of
                milk,
                often with moderate butterfat content, making them a staple in commercial dairy operations. Their docile
                nature allows for easy handling, and they are efficient feeders, contributing to their popularity among
                farmers. With a long history in dairy agriculture, Holsteins play a crucial role in the global dairy
                industry, providing a significant portion of the milk supply and supporting a wide range of dairy
                products,Holstein cows are renowned not only for their distinctive black-and-white patterns but also for
                their remarkable milk production capabilities, often averaging 22,000 to 25,000 pounds of milk per year.
                Today, the breed is used for milk in the north of Europe, and for meat in the south of Europe. After
                1945, European cattle breeding and dairy products became increasingly confined to certain regions due to
                the development of national infrastructure. This change led to the need to designate some animals for
                dairy production and others for beef production; previously, milk and beef had been produced from
                dual-purpose animals.

              <h5 class="card-title">Hereford cow</h5>
              <p class="card-text">The Hereford cow is a well-known beef breed recognized for its distinctive
                reddish-brown coat
                and white face, which make it easily identifiable. Originating in Herefordshire, England, Herefords are
                highly valued in the beef industry for their excellent meat quality, characterized by good marbling and
                tenderness. They are known for their docile temperament, making them relatively easy to manage and
                handle on
                farms. Herefords are also recognized for their adaptability to various climates and environments, which
                contributes to their widespread use in beef production worldwide. The breed is efficient in converting
                feed
                into weight gain, and their reproductive efficiency further enhances their appeal to cattle ranchers.
                With a
                long history in agriculture, Hereford cows continue to be a cornerstone of the beef industry, providing
                high-quality beef while also being bred for traits like hardiness and maternal ability,Hereford cows are
                celebrated not only for their distinctive appearance but also for their hardiness and adaptability to
                diverse environments, making them suitable for various farming systems. Many strains of Hereford have
                used other cattle breeds to import desired characteristics, which has led to changes in the breed as a
                whole. However, some strains have been kept separate and retained characteristics of the earlier breed,
                such as hardiness and thriftiness.[17] The Traditional Hereford is now treated as a minority breed of
                value for genetic conservationEye cancer (ocular squamous cell carcinoma) occurs in Herefords, notably
                in countries with continued bright sunlight and among those that prefer traits of low levels of red
                pigmentation round the eye.[19][20][21] Studies of eye cancer in Hereford cattle in the US and Canada.</p>
