              <h5 class="card-title">Malayan tiger</h5>
              <p class="card-text">The Malayan tiger, scientifically known as *Panthera tigris jacksoni*, is a
                subspecies native
                to the southern Malay Peninsula. Characterized by its striking coat of dark stripes against a golden
                background, this tiger is slightly smaller than other subspecies like the Bengal tiger, with a more
                slender
                build. It primarily inhabits tropical forests, relying on dense vegetation for hunting prey such as deer
                and
                wild boar. Unfortunately, the Malayan tiger faces significant threats from habitat destruction and
                poaching,
                leading to its classification as endangered. Conservation efforts are critical to preserving this iconic
                species and its habitat, as its survival is closely tied to the health of the forest ecosystems it
                inhabits,the Malayan tiger is a wild tiger subspecies. It roams the forests and jungles of the southern
                Malay Peninsula, where it hunts for prey and establishes its territory. As a top predator, it plays a
                vital
                role in maintaining the balance of its ecosystem. However, due to threats like habitat loss and
                poaching,
                the wild populations of Malayan tigers are in decline, making conservation efforts crucial for their
                survival,The Malayan tiger, a distinct subspecies of tiger, is primarily found in the central and
                southern
                regions of the Malay Peninsula. It is known for its relatively small size compared to other tiger
                subspecies, with males typically weighing between 120 to 140 pounds and females slightly smaller.The
                geographic division between Malayan and Indochinese tigers is unclear as tiger populations in northern
                Malaysia are contiguous with those in southern Thailand.[3]

                Tigers abounded on Singapore Island in the 1830s when it was still a dense jungle and were also seen
                crossing the Strait of Johor. The first fatal attack of a tiger on a human was reported in 1831. Tiger
                hunting became a sport in those years.[17] The expansion of plantations on Singapore Island led to more
                encounters between humans and tigers; daily tiger attacks were reported in the late 1840s.</p>

              <h5 class="card-title">Caspian tiger</h5>
              <p class="card-text">The Caspian tiger, a now-extinct subspecies, once inhabited the regions surrounding
                the
                Caspian Sea, including parts of modern-day Turkey, Iran, and Central Asia. Known for its robust build
                and
                adaptability to diverse environments, it thrived in various habitats, from dense forests to rugged
                mountains. With a distinctive coat featuring bold stripes, the Caspian tiger was larger than some of its
                relatives, which added to its majestic presence. Unfortunately, it faced severe threats from habitat
                loss,
                hunting, and depletion of prey species, leading to its decline. The last confirmed sightings of this
                subspecies occurred in the 1970s, marking the end of its existence. The extinction of the Caspian tiger
                highlights the critical need for conservation efforts to protect remaining tiger populations and their
                natural habitats,The Caspian tiger was a subspecies of tiger that inhabited areas around the Caspian
                Sea,
                including parts of Central Asia, Iran, and Turkey. Known for its larger size and thick coat, it was
                well-adapted to various environments, from forests to mountainous regions.In 2015, morphological,
                ecological and molecular traits of all putative tiger subspecies were analysed in a combined approach.
                Results support distinction of the two evolutionary groups continental and Sunda tigers. The authors
                proposed recognition of only two subspecies, namely P. t. tigris comprising the Bengal, Malayan,
                Indochinese, South Chinese, Siberian and Caspian tiger populations, and P. t. sondaica comprising the
                Javan, Bali and Sumatran tiger populations. </p>

              <h5 class="card-title">Siberian tiger</h5>
              <p class="card-text">The Siberian tiger, also known as the Amur tiger, is the largest of all tiger
                subspecies,
                primarily found in the forests of eastern Russia, particularly in the Russian Far East, as well as parts
                of
                northeastern China. Renowned for its impressive size, with males weighing between 400 to 600 pounds, it
                features a thick, pale coat with fewer and lighter stripes, adaptations that help it survive in harsh,
                cold
                climates. These solitary animals are skilled hunters, primarily preying on deer and wild boar. Despite
                its
                strength and adaptability, the Siberian tiger faces significant threats from habitat loss, poaching, and
                reduced prey availability, leading to its classification as endangered. Conservation efforts are
                critical to
                ensuring the survival of this magnificent species and its forest habitat.
                The Siberian tiger, also known as the Amur tiger, is the largest subspecies of tiger and is primarily
                found
                in the dense forests of eastern Russia and parts of northeastern China. These magnificent animals are
                distinguished by their thick, pale orange coats adorned with bold black stripes, which provide effective
                camouflage in their snowy and forested habitats. Males can weigh between 400 and 600 pounds and can
                measure
                over ten feet long, including their long tails.The Siberian tiger is genetically close to the
                now-extinct Caspian tiger. Results of a phylogeographic study comparing mitochondrial DNA from Caspian
                tigers and living tiger populations indicate that the common ancestor of the Siberian and Caspian tigers
                colonized Central Asia from eastern China, via the Gansu−Silk Road corridor, and then subsequently
                traversed Siberia eastward to establish the Siberian tiger population in the Russian Far East.[8] The
                Caspian and Siberian tiger populations were the northernmost in mainland Asia.The Siberian tiger was also called "Amur tiger".</p>
