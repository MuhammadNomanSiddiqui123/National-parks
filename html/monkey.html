              <h5 class="card-title">Macaques</h5>
              <p class="card-text">Macaques are a diverse group of primates belonging to the genus Macaca, primarily
                found across
                Asia and North Africa. Known for their adaptability, these monkeys thrive in a variety of habitats, from
                forests to urban areas. They are highly social animals, living in troops that exhibit complex social
                structures and behaviors. Macaques are recognized for their intelligence and problem-solving abilities,
                often using tools and engaging in intricate social interactions. Some species, like the Japanese
                macaque,
                are famous for their unique behaviors, such as bathing in hot springs during winter. Their versatile
                diet
                includes fruits, seeds, and small animals, allowing them to thrive in different environments,Macaques
                are
                fascinating primates with a wide range of characteristics and behaviors. They typically have a robust
                body,
                long limbs, and a non-prehensile tail. Their fur color can vary significantly between species, ranging
                from
                light brown to gray or even black,Macaques are also notable for their intelligence. They can learn tasks
                quickly and are adept at problem-solving, which has made them a subject of scientific research. Aside
                from humans (genus Homo), the macaques are the most widespread primate genus, ranging from Japan to the
                Indian subcontinent, and in the case of the Barbary macaque (Macaca sylvanus), to North Africa and
                Southern Europe. Twenty-three macaque species are currently recognized. Macaques are robust primates
                whose arms and legs are about the same in length. The fur of these animals is typically varying shades.

              <h5 class="card-title">Cebidae</h5>
              <p class="card-text">Cebidae is a family of New World monkeys that includes species like capuchins and
                squirrel
                monkeys, primarily found in Central and South America. These primates are characterized by their high
                intelligence and agility, often displaying sophisticated social behaviors and problem-solving skills.
                Cebids
                typically have prehensile tails, which assist them in navigating their arboreal habitats. Their diets
                are
                diverse, consisting of fruits, insects, and small animals, reflecting their adaptability to various
                environments. Socially, they often live in cohesive groups, forming strong bonds through grooming and
                cooperative activities. Overall, Cebidae monkeys are notable for their complex behaviors and
                interactions,
                making them an important subject of study in primatology,Cebidae, the family of New World monkeys,
                includes
                notable species like capuchins and squirrel monkeys, which are renowned for their remarkable cognitive
                abilities and playful nature. Capuchins, for instance, are often recognized for their use of tools, such
                as
                using stones to crack open nuts.
                Females give birth to one or two young after a gestation period of between 130 and 170 days, depending
                on species. They are social animals, living in groups of between five and forty individuals, with the
                smaller species typically forming larger groups. They are generally diurnal in habit.Previously, New
                World monkeys were divided between Callitrichidae and this family. For a few recent years, marmosets,
                tamarins, and lion tamarins were placed as a subfamily (Callitrichinae) in Cebidae. </p>

              <h5 class="card-title">The night monkey</h5>
              <p class="card-text">The night monkey, or owl monkey, is a unique primate belonging to the genus Aotus,
                known for
                being the only truly nocturnal monkey species. Native to Central and South America, these monkeys are
                easily
                recognizable by their large, expressive eyes, which are specially adapted for low-light environments.
                Night
                monkeys typically form monogamous pairs, with both parents actively participating in raising their
                offspring, highlighting their strong family bonds. Their diet mainly consists of fruits, leaves, and
                insects, and their nocturnal lifestyle allows them to avoid many predators active during the day. This
                distinctive behavior, along with their social structures and adaptations, makes night monkeys a
                fascinating
                subject of study in the field of primatology,Night monkeys, or owl monkeys, are intriguing primates
                recognized for their unique adaptations to a nocturnal lifestyle. Night monkeys are threatened by
                habitat loss, the pet trade, hunting for bushmeat, and by biomedical research. They constitute one of
                the few monkey species affected by the often deadly human malaria protozoan Plasmodium falciparum and
                are therefore used as experimental subjects in malaria research. The Peruvian night monkey is classified
                by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.</p>
