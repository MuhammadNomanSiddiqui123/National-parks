              <h5 class="card-title">African grey parrot</h5>
              <p class="card-text">The African grey parrot is a medium-sized bird known for its exceptional intelligence
                and ability to mimic
                human speech. With a mostly grey plumage and striking red tail feathers, these parrots typically measure
                about 12 to 14 inches in length. They are highly social and thrive on interaction, making them engaging
                companions. African greys can live for 40 to 60 years in captivity and require a balanced diet, mental
                stimulation, and social interaction to stay healthy and happy. Found in Central and West Africa, they
                live
                The grey parrot (Psittacus erithacus), also known as the Congo grey parrot, African grey parrot or Congo
                African grey parrot, is an African parrot in the family Psittacidae. The Timneh parrot (Psittacus
                timneh) was previously treated as a subspecies of the grey parrot, but has since been elevated to a full
                species.A population study published in 2015 found that the species had been "virtually eliminated" from
                Ghana with numbers declining 90 to 99% since 1992.[14] They were found in only 10 of 42 forested areas,
                and three roosts that once held 700–1200 birds each, now had only 18 in total. he grey parrot is native
                to equatorial Africa, including Angola, Cameroon, the Congo, Gabon, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Kenya, and
                Uganda. The species is found inside a range from Kenya to the eastern part of the Ivory Coast.[12][13]
                Current estimates for the global population are uncertain and range from 630,000 to 13 million birds.
                Populations are decreasing worldwide.[13] The species seems to favour dense forests.]</p>

              <h5 class="card-title">Cockatoos </h5>
              <p class="card-text">Cockatoos are a group of large, intelligent parrots known for their striking crests
                and vocal
                abilities. They come in various species, each with unique colors and personalities. Native to Australia,
                New
                Guinea, and nearby islands, cockatoos are social birds that often live in flocks. They are known for
                their
                playful nature and can be quite affectionate with their owners if kept as pets. Do you have a specific
                question about cockatoos,Species
                There are around 21 species of cockatoos, including well-known types like,Sulphur-Crested Cockatoo
                recognizable by its striking yellow crest and often seen in urban areas.
                Umbrella Cockatoo: Known for its large, white plumage and prominent crest, this species is very social
                and
                affectionate. The phylogenetic position of the cockatiel remains unresolved, except that it is one of
                the earliest offshoots of the cockatoo lineage. The remaining species are in two main clades. The five
                large black-coloured cockatoos of the genus Calyptorhynchus form one branch.Cockatoos are popular birds
                in aviculture, but their needs are difficult to meet. The cockatiel is the easiest cockatoo species to
                maintain and is by far the most frequently kept in captivity. White cockatoos are more commonly found in
                captivity than black cockatoos.
                Cockatoos prefer to eat seeds, tubers, corms, fruit, flowers and insects. They often feed in large
                flocks, particularly when ground-feeding. Cockatoos are monogamous and nest in tree hollows. Some
                cockatoo species have been adversely affected by habitat loss, particularly from a shortage of suitable
                nesting hollows after large mature trees are cleared.</p>

              <p class="card-text">The kea is a large parrot measuring 46 to 50 cm (18 to 20 in) in total length, with
                some specimens possibly reaching 55 cm (22 in). Adult kea weigh between 750 and 1,000 g
                (1.65 and 2.20 lb), with males averaging 956 g (2.108 lb) and females averaging 779 g (1.717 lb). One
                source listed the mean adult weight as 922 g (2.033 lb) It has mostly olive-green plumage
                with a grey beak having a long, narrow, curved upper beak. The adult has dark-brown irises, and the
                cere, eyerings, and legs are grey. It has orange feathers on the undersides of its wings. The feathers
                on the sides of its face are dark olive-brown, the ones on its back and rump are orange-red, and some of
                the outer wing feathers are dull blue. It has a short, broad, bluish-green tail with a black tip.
                Feather shafts project at the tip of the tail and the undersides of the inner tail feathers have
                yellow-orange transverse stripes.The kea is one of nine living endemic parrot species in New Zealand.The
                kea is one of nine living endemic parrot species in New Zealand.[26]
                Kea sign at Arthur's Pass
                The kea ranges from lowland river valleys and coastal forests of the South Island's west coast up to
                alpine regions of the South Island such as Arthur's Pass and Aoraki / Mount Cook National Park. It is
                closely associated throughout its range with the southern beech (Nothofagus) forests in the alpine
                ridge.[27]
                Apart from occasional vagrants, kea today are not found in the North Island. Subfossil kea bones have
                been found in sand dunes at Mataikona in the eastern Wairarapa.Two to five white eggs are laid, with an
                incubation time of around 21 days.

              <h5 class="card-title"> kākā </h5>
              <p class="card-text">The kākā is a fascinating parrot native to New Zealand, recognized for its
                distinctive
                olive-brown plumage and vibrant red-orange feathers that can be seen under its wings. These medium-sized
                birds, typically measuring around 48 to 55 centimeters in length, are highly social creatures, often
                found
                in small flocks. Their vocalizations are a mix of whistles and squawks, creating a lively atmosphere in
                the
                forests they inhabit. Kākā are intelligent and curious, frequently engaging in playful behaviors and
                exploring their surroundings, As herbivores, they primarily feed on fruits, seeds, nuts, and flowers,
                with a
                particular affinity for native beech trees.Kākā beak morphology also differs slightly from its closest
                relatives, the Kea and Kākāpō. The rhinotheca (upper part of the beak) of the Kākā is narrower than the
                Kākāpo and slightly longer. However, it is not as long and sharp as the rhinotheca seen in kea.
                Therefore, the Kākā’s bill is between the kea and Kākāpō in length, sharpness, and width.The Kākā was
                once widespread throughout most of New Zealand; however, due to habitat modification, predation and
                resource competition from introduced animals, its distribution has now significantly decreased.[19] Its
                strongholds are currently the offshore reserves of Kapiti Island, Codfish Island / Whenua Hou and Little
                Barrier Island. As of 2021, less than 50% of the Kākā population was found on the mainland.It is
                breeding rapidly in the mainland island sanctuary at Zealandia with over 800 birds banded since their
                reintroduction in 2002.</p>
